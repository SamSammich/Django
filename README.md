# Django

Being a web framework, Django needs a convenient way to generate HTML dynamically. 
The most common approach relies on templates. 
A template contains the static parts of the desired HTML output as well as some special syntax describing how dynamic content will be inserted.

In this project, I used templates for creating a webpage, please do not judge, after all, this is my first project where I am using templates
